The bridge led not over the river, but into another world.
They say the lake is a portal to the stars.
The birds carried messages from the gods.

The old well was the fountain of youth.
The crows were time's guardians.
A shadow never fading as long as there is light.
The milk of life flows in streams.
The blacksmith of fate forges everyone's life.
In the forest of souls the dead find rest.
The bridge to immortality is narrow and dangerous.
They say the lake of truth shows everyone their true self.
The birds of hope sing when all seems lost.
A shadow of the past determining the future.
The bell of peace rings for eternity.
The fog of oblivion takes every pain.
The old woman of wisdom knows all answers.
A child of love defeats every hate.
The rats of betrayal gnaw at power's foundations.
The lake of dreams makes wishes come true.
The statue of justice judges without mercy.
A book of secrets never to be opened.
The wind of change brings new things.

They say the forest of wonders is full of surprises.
The old well of knowledge grants deep knowledge.
The crows of wisdom see everything.
A shadow of doubt gnawing at belief.
The milk of mercy nourishes the poor.
The blacksmith of dreams shapes the night.
In the forest of silence you hear only your own heartbeat.
The bridge of trust bears every burden.
They say the lake of eternity has no beginning and no end.
The birds of freedom know no borders.
A shadow of love never yielding.
The bell of joy sounds bright and clear.
The mist of security wraps gently.
The old woman of comfort dries every tear.
A child of hope brings light into darkness.
The rats of greed eat everything bare.
The lake of calm reflects the sky.
The statue of power stands firm and unshakeable.
A book of lies sounding beautiful but poisonous.
The wind of freedom blows where it wants.
The shadows of the past won't let go.
They say the forest of memory keeps everything.
The old well of youth makes young again.
The crows of misfortune bring bad news.
A shadow of hope never dying.
The milk of friendship connects.
The blacksmith of luck forges fate.
In the forest of adventure dangers and treasures wait.
The bridge of love connects two hearts.
They say the lake of sorrow is salty with tears.
The birds of longing fly far away.
A shadow of fear paralyzing.
The bell of warning rings at danger.
The fog of deception leads astray.
The old woman of revenge never forgets.
A child of innocence sees the world with amazed eyes.
The rats of disease bring death.
The lake of clarity shows the way.
The statue of beauty blinds the eye.
A book of truth hard to bear.
The wind of passion kindles the fire.
The shadows of loneliness are cold and empty.
They say the forest of spirits is full of lost souls.
The old well of wishes grants every wish, but at a price.
The crows of night bring darkness.
In the cellar of the inn a secret passage is said to lead to the castle.
The old oak was struck by lightning, but it still blooms.
Sometimes you smell the scent of fresh baked bread in the forest where no hut is.
The river has a current strong enough to carry away a horse.
The birds sing songs in the morning sounding like human melodies.
A shadow fell on my book, but no one was there.
The bell rings for vespers, even if the sexton is sick.
The fog swallows all light, even that of lanterns.
The old woman knits scarves for children not yet born.
A child told me of a city of glass floating in the sky.
The rats avoid the house at the end of the street.
The lake is so deep no one ever reached the bottom.
The statue holds a sword sharper than any blade.
A book where the history of every person reading it is written.
The wind always blows from the direction of the cemetery, no matter the weather.
The shadows grow longer when you are afraid.
They say the forest never forgets what happened in it.
The old well is so deep you don't hear a stone hitting.
The crows know more than they say if you speak their language.
A shadow followed me to my doorstep and waited there.
The milk turned sour when the clock struck midnight.
The blacksmith sometimes hammers all night, though he has no order.
In the forest a abandoned campfire was found still burning.
